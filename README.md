What is ES2015?
===============
"ES2015" is short for "ECMAScript 2015".  It is the current standard for the JavaScript language, which browsers must implement to be standards compliant.

**What is ECMA?**

ECMA stands for "European Computer Manufacturers Association".  It's the standards body that maintains what offical ECMAScript/JavaScript is, which browsers then implement so that the same JavaScript code can work in any browser environment.

**'ES6' vs. 'ES2015'**

New standards of ECMAScript had in the past been rolled out with release numbers (ES3, ES5).   ES6 was set to be the newest relased, but the standards body has decided to aim at a new official standard every year.  So now we'll have ES2015, ES2016, etc.

You can read Kyle Simpson's circa Feb 2015 thoughts on the naming of the standard, [here][ks] (that link goes to part of an entire book, available on GitHub, which he has written on the new JavaScript features).

Transpiling ES2015 to ES5
=========================
Because certain features of ES2015 are not universally implemented on different browsers, if you want to write ES2015 code right now that can work anywhere you will need to "transpile" your ES2015 code to ES5.

**What is transpiling?**

Transpiling is a subset of compiling: transforming source code from one language to another.  Traditional compilation moves from a higher to a lower level of abstraction (e.g., compiling C source code to binary). Transpiling is compiling source code to source code at a similar level of abstraction (e.g., Sass/Less, which are CSS pre-processors, to CSS).  To get ES2015 JavaScript to run in any modern browser environment, it needs to be transpiled to ES5 JavaScript.

**Transpiling ES2015 with Babel**

The main tool for transpiling ES2015 is [Babel][bab].  For actual production projects, you will want to transpile as part of a build process through something like [Browserfy][br] or [webpack][wp].  [Node Catapult][nc], a JavaScript application starter kit,  For experimentation purposes, you can manually transpile using the Babel command-line tools:

***Command-Line Babel Transpiling Recipe***

Babel can be installed as an NPM Module.  Unlike many command-line tools that you will want to install globally, you may want to have different versions of Babel running for different projects, so install it locally.

1. Create a directory, cd in, then run:
2. `npm init`
3. `npm install --save-dev babel-cli`
4. `npm install --save-dev babel-preset-es2015`
5. `echo '{ "presets": ["es2015"] }' > .babelrc`
6. `./node_modules/.bin/babel --out-file destinationFile.js sourceFile.js`
    
Run the last command everytime you want to transpile. You could also alias the command to an npm script--e.g., "npm build".

Syntactic Sugar
===============
A lot of ES2015 features are "syntactic sugar": ways to peform similar operations with cleaner code or less cumbersome syntax.  An example of syntactic sugar would be the `+` operator for concatenating strings: `"Hello, " + "world!"` is syntactic sugar for `Hello, ".concat("world!")`.

Arrow Functions
===============
[Arrow Functions][af] are a new feature of JS that are one part syntactic sugar, one part new functionality.  As the MDN documentation says: 

>An arrow function expression (also known as fat arrow function) has a shorter syntax compared to function expressions and lexically binds the this value (does not bind its own this, arguments, super, or new.target). Arrow functions are always anonymous.

As anonymous functions, they are most often useful in cases where you have a short functions.  Take a function that adds together all the values passed into it as arguments.  The ES5 way of doing this would be:

**Arrow functions syntactic sugar**
`
function add(){
    var nums = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);
    return nums.reduce( function(accum, val) {
        return accum + val ;
    });
}

add(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) // output >> 15
`

Using arrow functions, we no longer need to use the `function` keyword in our callback.  We simply declare our function with the following syntax: `(params) => { //function body }`:

`
function add(){
    var nums = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);
    return nums.reduce( (accum, val) => {
        return accum + val ;
    });
}
`

Furthermore, when our function body is only one-line long, we can omit the braces and the explicit return statement:

`
function add(){
    var nums = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);
    return nums.reduce( (accum, val) => accum + val );
}
`

The final bit of syntactic sugar arrow functions provide is the ability to omit parentheses when our function only takes one argument:

`
function multiplyBy2(){
    var nums = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);
    return nums.map( num => num * 2);
}

multiplyBy2(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) // output >> [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
`

**No dynamic this binding**

The syntactic sugar arrow functions make available can provide a nice way for writing cleaner, easier-to-read callback functions.  They do have one functional difference from anonymous functions declared with the keyword `function`, however, which has to do with the binding of `this` inside of the function body.

In plain old JavaScript functions, `this` gets bound at call time. If we run the following code, our step function will log "undefined" to the console every interval.

`
    var NameLogger = function(name, time){
        this.time = time;
        this.name = name;
        this.step = function(){
            setInterval( function() { 
             console.log(this.name);
            }, this.time);
        };
    };
    var logger = new NameLogger("Ignacio", 500);
    logger.step(); 
    /*
    logs =>
    undefined
    undefined
    undefined...
    */
`
The reason that it logs "undefined" is that our callback function (a plain old JS function) is a "free function": it is not the method of an object.  When that callback function is run, `this` is bound to the global object, rather than the object that we created with the `NameLogger` constructor, which is likely what was intended by the use of `this`.

If an arrow function were substituted for our plain old JS callback function, we would get the result we want:

`
    var NameLogger = function(name, time){
        this.time = time;
        this.name = name;
        this.step = () => {
            setInterval( function() { 
             console.log(this.name);
            }, this.time);
        };
    };
    var logger = new NameLogger("Ignacio", 500);
    logger.step(); 
    /*
    logs =>
    "Ignacio"
    "Ignacio"
    "Ignacio"...
    */
`

The reason for the difference in behavior between our arrow function and the plain old JS callback function is that arrow functions create no binding to `this` at call time.  If `this` appears in an arrow function body, it will be lexically bound.  So, when the constructor function is run, it will create a `this` binding to the object being constructed.  The arrow function creates no separate `this` binding, so occurrences of `this` inside of it will be bound to the same object.
